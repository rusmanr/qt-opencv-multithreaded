qt-opencv-multithreaded
=======================

11/11/2021:
update the code for opencv 4.2
tested using Qt5.15.2 on Ubuntu20.04and Window 10

Official project page: http://code.google.com/p/qt-opencv-multithreaded/

## Windows
### Visual Studio 2013
#### Environment
The build procedure has been tested and verified using:  
- Windows 7 Ultimate Service Pack 1 64-bit
- Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate Update 5  
- CMake 3.2.3: http://www.cmake.org/download/  
- OpenCV 3.0.0: http://opencv.org/downloads.html  
- Qt 5.5.0 (msvc2013_64): http://www.qt.io/download/

#### Preparation
Firstly, ensure the following are added to the Windows ```PATH``` variable (modified as required):  
- CMake executable: ```C:/Program Files (x86)/CMake/bin```  
- Qt libraries (DLLs): ```C:/Qt/Qt5.5.0/5.5/msvc2013_64/bin```  
- OpenCV libraries (DLLs): ```C:/Users/Nick/Desktop/opencv/build/x64/vc12```

#### Building
1. Create a build folder inside the top-level directory (this repository):  
```$ mkdir build```  
2. Navigate to created folder:  
```$ cd build```  
3. Run cmake (specify path to Qt installation and OpenCV and choose the desired Visual Studio generator):  
```$ cmake -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:/Qt/Qt5.5.0/5.5/msvc2013_64 -D OpenCV_DIR=C:/Users/Nick/Desktop/opencv/build -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" ..```  
4. Open generated *qt-opencv-multithreaded.sln* in Visual Studio 2013.  
5. After opening the solution, ensure you right-hand click the *qt-opencv-multithreaded* project and choose "Set as StartUp Project" for correct running and debugging within Visual Studio.  
6. Build the solution.
